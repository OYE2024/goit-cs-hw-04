The rise of edge computing is reshaping how data is processed and analyzed. With the explosion of IoT devices and smart applications, businesses need faster data processing to reduce latency and improve efficiency. Edge computing moves data processing closer to the source, reducing reliance on centralized cloud servers. This technology is particularly useful for industries such as healthcare, manufacturing, and autonomous vehicles, where real-time data processing is critical. As a result, investments in edge computing infrastructure will continue to grow in 2025.
